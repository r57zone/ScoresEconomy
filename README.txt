Scores economy is a description of an economic model in which participants provide services to each other free of charge, in their free time, receiving points as a reward, on a certain service or blockchain platform. The model will allow you to partially exclude money and receive services free of charge, among participants who are ready to provide these services for points credited to their personal rating.

Participants in the points economy offer services to other participants and can set the necessary rating for their provision. The rating is formed on the basis of the services provided by the participant. Points are awarded after the service is performed, the number of points is indicated by the participant who received the service, depending on his rating. The higher the rating of the participant, the more points he can provide, but at the same time his points are not spent, but the service or blockchain reflects the receipt of the service, in order to avoid fraud. Also, in order to avoid fraud, a minimum rating threshold for services is set.
